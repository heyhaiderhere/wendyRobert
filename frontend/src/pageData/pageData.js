Pigment changes and scarring issues, skin cancer, uneven skin tone, and folliculitis from shaving, dark spots, melasma, in grown hairs, eczema, psoriasis and even hair loss all disproportionately affect people of color. Scarring issues, especially keloids, which are excessive and disfiguring affect almost 16% of people of color. A condition called Dermatosis papulose nigra is small bumps that are not moles but appear as if they are. They are aesthetically unpleasing and affect many people of color.

Inflammatory skin conditions like eczema and psoriasis can affect the outcome of cosmetic procedures.

        description: `People of color have a lower risk of skin cancer, but are not immune. Unprotected sun exposure is the main risk factor for people of color. Unfortunately, people of color who develop skin cancer are at a disadvantage because it is more difficult to treat and is often diagnosed at a more advanced state.

        Basel cell carcinoma is the most common type of skin cancer diagnosed in African Americans and Latinos, and is usually found on the head and neck. The 5 year survival rate of melanoma in African Americans and Latinos is 73% while it is 91% for white people, primarily because it is diagnosed at a later stage.
        
        Skin cancer prevention is recommended. This means stay out of the sun, protect yourself with clothing, hats and sunglasses as well as a blocking sun screen. Take Vitamin D3 supplements, because people of color are at a higher risk of Vitamin D3 deficiency.
        
        People of color are at risk for skin cancers in areas not typically exposed to the sun. 30-40% of melanomas diagnosed in people of color are found on the bottom of the foot. About 8% of melanomas found in Asians are found in the mouth. The most commonly diagnosed type of cancer in African Americans is squamous cell carcinoma on the buttocks, hip, legs and feet.
        
        Dr. Roberts recommends you do a thorough skin exam on yourself on a monthly basis. Focus on the palms of the hands, soles of the feet, fingernails, toenails, mouth, groin and buttocks. Notice any areas that seem to be changing, itch or bleed, and any ulcers or wounds that do not heal.
        
        People of color benefit from a specialist in skin of color because skin color also affects your response to cosmetic procedures. Skin of color differs not only by color, but also aging patterns and a distinct pattern of cosmetic problems.
        
        To aid in the ability to understand how a particular color type and will respond, Dr. Roberts has pioneered the Roberts Skin Type Classification System©. This groundbreaking approach is the key to predicting the skin’s likely response to insult, injury and inflammation for people of color. The information is used to address the special concerns and challenges of multicultural ethic skin.

        This classification system comprehensively identifies skin type characteristics that can help determine the appropriate course of treatment, clarify post-procedure expectations, and optimize outcomes for better skin care. It is an individualized approach that identifies the features and elements of various skin color types to predict potential complications so they can be avoided. It includes determination of the skin’s phototype and photoage, pigmentation risks, and scarring risks. This assists Dr. Roberts in evaluating a patient’s skin and developing a cosmetic plan. All this information will positively impact Dr. Roberts’ communications with you, your awareness of your skin type’s problems and treatments, compliance and preventive measures.
        
        It is important to identify skin type before undergoing any cosmetic procedures, especially:`,

Brown skinned people are more vulnerable to melasma, vitiligo and certain medications like blood pressure meds, diabetes and heart disease meds that can cause brown skin to discolor. Simple skin irritations like acne and ingrown hairs can cause discoloration. The hair of black women who shampoo daily tends to exacerbate dry scalp and increase breakage. Sadly, many women of color from different cultural backgrounds may react differently to the same procedures and often may receive inappropriate treatments unless they seek care from a specialist in skin of color, like Dr. Roberts.`,

There are numerous areas of the face that can benefit from Botox, Dysport and Xeomin, such as the glabellar lines, marionette lines, upper lip lines, and laugh lines, all of which can deepen over time. These lines may not be noticeable in your twenties, but in your late thirties and forties, these lines start to become permanently etched into your skin. The best way to address them is to inject small amount of Botox, Dysport or Xeomin into the muscles, which temporarily allows the muscles to “forget” how to make that particular motion. This is how the lines begin to smooth.

        description: `Exilis is an FDA approved non-invasive treatment for body shaping, skin tightening and facial rejuvenation. This non-invasive treatment uses radio-frequency waves to deliver controlled heat under the skin at various depths to stimulate collage production for firming and smoothing the skin; to reduce wrinkles and rejuvenate the skin; and for cellulite reduction. It works for all skin types, is safe and effective with no downtime.

        This technology is also used for fat reduction by melting fat cells, and tightening the skin to lose inches in problem areas like the neck, jowls, arms, bra strap area, abdomen, chest, thighs and knees. Exilis is a treatment for cellulite.
        
        In 2014, New Beauty Magazine named Exilis as the Best Skin Tightener on the market. They state that “Exilis is scientifically proven and clinically tested to redefine the face, neck, arms, stomach, hips, thighs, and other trouble areas in just a few treatments.”`,

The Exilis radiofrequency heat breaks down collagen which forces the body to produce new collagen and results in less wrinkling and tighter skin. The process of new collagen production can take a few weeks to a few months.

        The radiofrequency energy causes the tissue to contract and tighten down to the deepest level of your skin. The heat melts fat cells in a process called lipolysis. The dead fat cells are reabsorbed into the body and removed through the lymph system. The temperature sensor guides the depth of penetration allowing more precise contouring. Exilis has a built-in cooling device to safely treat lax skin and excess fat. This makes it safe for used on the face, neck and jowls and any other sensitive areas.`,

Its ability to stimulate collagen as a reaction to treatment produces natural results.

        Many patients lose one to two inches after the first treatment. For maximum results, four treatments, two weeks apart may be necessary. Fat loss will be visible almost immediately after treatment. It will take about 2-3 months for your body to produce collagen which results in tightening of the skin.
        
        Exilis is not liposuction and will not produce the same results. But if you aren’t ready for a tummy tuck and/or liposuction, this non-surgical option can perfect your body.

After each treatment, patients will see significant improvement, continuing throughout the series of injections.

        Dr. Roberts will consult with patients to determine the combination of liquid injectables that will work best to address their needs. Dermal fillers such as Restylane, Perlane, Juvederm, Radiesse, and Sculptra may be used in order to address areas of volume loss and excessive lines and wrinkles that are causing the skin to look aged.`,
