Pigment changes and scarring issues, skin cancer, uneven skin tone, and folliculitis from shaving, dark spots, melasma, in grown hairs, eczema, psoriasis and even hair loss all disproportionately affect people of color. Scarring issues, especially keloids, which are excessive and disfiguring affect almost 16% of people of color. A condition called Dermatosis papulose nigra is small bumps that are not moles but appear as if they are. They are aesthetically unpleasing and affect many people of color.

Inflammatory skin conditions like eczema and psoriasis can affect the outcome of cosmetic procedures. Injectibles can result in hypertrophic scarring at the injection site, and in some cases discoloration in skin of color. For all these reasons, it is vital to have your skin analyzed by Dr. Roberts before any procedures are scheduled.`,

        description: `People of color have a lower risk of skin cancer, but are not immune. Unprotected sun exposure is the main risk factor for people of color. Unfortunately, people of color who develop skin cancer are at a disadvantage because it is more difficult to treat and is often diagnosed at a more advanced state.

        Basel cell carcinoma is the most common type of skin cancer diagnosed in African Americans and Latinos, and is usually found on the head and neck. The 5 year survival rate of melanoma in African Americans and Latinos is 73% while it is 91% for white people, primarily because it is diagnosed at a later stage.
        
        Skin cancer prevention is recommended. This means stay out of the sun, protect yourself with clothing, hats and sunglasses as well as a blocking sun screen. Take Vitamin D3 supplements, because people of color are at a higher risk of Vitamin D3 deficiency.
        
        People of color are at risk for skin cancers in areas not typically exposed to the sun. 30-40% of melanomas diagnosed in people of color are found on the bottom of the foot. About 8% of melanomas found in Asians are found in the mouth. The most commonly diagnosed type of cancer in African Americans is squamous cell carcinoma on the buttocks, hip, legs and feet.
        
        Dr. Roberts recommends you do a thorough skin exam on yourself on a monthly basis. Focus on the palms of the hands, soles of the feet, fingernails, toenails, mouth, groin and buttocks. Notice any areas that seem to be changing, itch or bleed, and any ulcers or wounds that do not heal.
        
        People of color benefit from a specialist in skin of color because skin color also affects your response to cosmetic procedures. Skin of color differs not only by color, but also aging patterns and a distinct pattern of cosmetic problems.
        
        To aid in the ability to understand how a particular color type and will respond, Dr. Roberts has pioneered the Roberts Skin Type Classification System©. This groundbreaking approach is the key to predicting the skin’s likely response to insult, injury and inflammation for people of color. The information is used to address the special concerns and challenges of multicultural ethic skin.

        This classification system comprehensively identifies skin type characteristics that can help determine the appropriate course of treatment, clarify post-procedure expectations, and optimize outcomes for better skin care. It is an individualized approach that identifies the features and elements of various skin color types to predict potential complications so they can be avoided. It includes determination of the skin’s phototype and photoage, pigmentation risks, and scarring risks. This assists Dr. Roberts in evaluating a patient’s skin and developing a cosmetic plan. All this information will positively impact Dr. Roberts’ communications with you, your awareness of your skin type’s problems and treatments, compliance and preventive measures.

Brown skinned people are more vulnerable to melasma, vitiligo and certain medications like blood pressure meds, diabetes and heart disease meds that can cause brown skin to discolor. Simple skin irritations like acne and ingrown hairs can cause discoloration. The hair of black women who shampoo daily tends to exacerbate dry scalp and increase breakage. Sadly, many women of color from different cultural backgrounds may react differently to the same procedures and often may receive inappropriate treatments unless they seek care from a specialist in skin of color, like Dr. Roberts.`,

There are numerous areas of the face that can benefit from Botox, Dysport and Xeomin, such as the glabellar lines, marionette lines, upper lip lines, and laugh lines, all of which can deepen over time. These lines may not be noticeable in your twenties, but in your late thirties and forties, these lines start to become permanently etched into your skin. The best way to address them is to inject small amount of Botox, Dysport or Xeomin into the muscles, which temporarily allows the muscles to “forget” how to make that particular motion. This is how the lines begin to smooth.

        Laser hair removal is done in a series of sessions. Treatment sessions will vary in length and number dependent upon the hair type, skin type, and the area that is being treated. Anywhere from up to ten sessions are needed for optimal results. Treatments for legs, back, and chest will likely take longer than treatments for areas of the body such as the face, armpits, or bikini line.

Chemical peels are much lighter than they used to be, but are extremely effective. This particular dermatological treatment can help remove brown spots, sun spots, and can help make the skin look fresher in appearance, as well as smoother and more firm.

        Chemical peels are done in a series of treatments, and can be anywhere from three to six peels.

Sculptra lasts up to two years; however, the results take time to develop, as collagen is created in response to the injections.

        description: `Exilis is an FDA approved non-invasive treatment for body shaping, skin tightening and facial rejuvenation. This non-invasive treatment uses radio-frequency waves to deliver controlled heat under the skin at various depths to stimulate collage production for firming and smoothing the skin; to reduce wrinkles and rejuvenate the skin; and for cellulite reduction. It works for all skin types, is safe and effective with no downtime.

        This technology is also used for fat reduction by melting fat cells, and tightening the skin to lose inches in problem areas like the neck, jowls, arms, bra strap area, abdomen, chest, thighs and knees. Exilis is a treatment for cellulite.
        
        In 2014, New Beauty Magazine named Exilis as the Best Skin Tightener on the market. They state that “Exilis is scientifically proven and clinically tested to redefine the face, neck, arms, stomach, hips, thighs, and other trouble areas in just a few treatments.”`,

        subHeading: "How does Exilis work?",
        description: `Collagen is abundant in the skin and with elastin provides tone, texture and elasticity. As we age collagen production decreases. The Exilis radiofrequency heat breaks down collagen which forces the body to produce new collagen and results in less wrinkling and tighter skin. The process of new collagen production can take a few weeks to a few months.

        The radiofrequency energy causes the tissue to contract and tighten down to the deepest level of your skin. The heat melts fat cells in a process called lipolysis. The dead fat cells are reabsorbed into the body and removed through the lymph system. The temperature sensor guides the depth of penetration allowing more precise contouring. Exilis has a built-in cooling device to safely treat lax skin and excess fat. This makes it safe for used on the face, neck and jowls and any other sensitive areas.`,

        description: `Exilis is best for stubborn fatty deposits in areas where diet and exercise just don’t work. It is effective for spot reduction and circumference reduction in the thighs and waist. This includes love handles, inner thighs and abdomen. Its ability to stimulate collagen as a reaction to treatment produces natural results.

        Many patients lose one to two inches after the first treatment. For maximum results, four treatments, two weeks apart may be necessary. Fat loss will be visible almost immediately after treatment. It will take about 2-3 months for your body to produce collagen which results in tightening of the skin.
        
        Exilis is not liposuction and will not produce the same results. But if you aren’t ready for a tummy tuck and/or liposuction, this non-surgical option can perfect your body.
        
        Only a board-certified dermatologist should perform the treatments to achieve the best results. Fat cell reduction should be long lasting. Skin tightening may require maintenance treatments, as we never stop aging and loosing collagen.`,

        For a pain-free, affordable solution to those trouble spots, Exilis provides reliable skin tightening not only on the face and neck, but is especially good for loose skin after pregnancy. It is excellent for tightening the skin on the upper arms without the need for an arm lift. Safe for patients of all ages looking for aesthetic improvement without the cost and recovery of surgical solutions.
        
        To create a streamlined silhouette and tighten skin Exilis is the way to a better body. For precise lifting and contouring Exilis beats Thermage. No topical anesthetic or pain medications are needed.

Platelets are the body’s tool to naturally heal and grow new cells to rebuild your skin. The serum stimulates the growth of new tissue and collagen for volume, produce new fatty tissue for smoothness and new blood vessels for that healthy glow. The procedure is safe and simple. The benefits of PRP occur gradually over the course of three to six months. Results can last up to 2 years.`,

        description: `Because PRP comes from you, there is no risk of allergies. It is safe and effective. The platelet derived growth factors are pivotal in tissue repair and regeneration. The plasma proteins are key to connective tissue and skin support, and promote extracellular matrixes for tissue generation and cellular therapy. Together they have an overall rejuvenating effect refining skin texture and tone, improving fine lines and wrinkles, and replenishing lost collagen and elastin to add volume for natural results.

        PRP applications on the scalp activate hair follicles to become healthier and stronger, producing more robust hair growth. The growth factors in PRP promote rapid cell growth and angiogenesis. Effective for both male and female pattern hair loss, PRP can regrow hair in alopecia areas, eyebrow hair loss and cases of non-hereditary hair loss.`,

Varicose veins, which often range in color from red to blue, can be caused by a variety of reasons including genetics, excessive standing, hormonal changes, or health problems. When these issues occur, they can be very unsightly and be a source of embarrassment and self-consciousness for these individuals.

Thicker, larger veins may need to be reduced using vein lasers, but Dr. Roberts will determine the most comfortable and effective treatment plan for your situation.

In fact, the Skin Cancer Foundation reports cure rates of 98 percent or greater. Dr. Roberts is at the forefront of diagnosing and treating skin cancer.

        The key to Mohs surgery is that the excised tissue is examined, by the surgeon under the microscope during the surgery as opposed to other methods which occur after surgery. This critical procedural difference eliminates the need to over-estimate how deep the skin cancer goes. Instead it allows for small, thin layers to be removed and studied under a microscope to evaluate if cancer cells are present. Once a layer is reached where the margins of the tissue are cancer-free, the surgery is complete. It eliminates any guesswork in the skin cancer removal process, which generates unparalleled therapeutic results for each patient.
        
        Further, by saving almost all normal, non-cancerous tissue during the process, repairing the area with facial plastic reconstruction produces far better results. Dr. Roberts is an expert in skin cancer removal and provides the highest quality cosmetic results.

        Voluma can add back that lost volume and make a tremendous difference in terms of reducing the signs of aging. Typically, the mid-face is one of the first areas that shows the signs of aging. We lose our facial fat, contours sharpen and the cheeks appear hollow. Voluma can restore fullness, and the soft contours of a youthful face.

All of those reasons and more are why our permanent makeup treatments are so popular.

        The process is simple: it’s a cosmetic tattoo that allows for pigments of color right into the dermal layer of your skin. This is done with a small, handheld, and sterile tool. It’s the perfect way to enhance your natural beauty and facial features. The best part is, it lasts for a couple of years and can last even longer with additional treatments and touchups.`,

A gentle daily cleanser free of sulfates or formulated for dry skin is the ideal choice for your morning and night cleanse.

        Many people prefer to use a double cleanse method, especially if make-up removal is on the table. A double cleanse method starts with an oil-based cleanser that removes surface dirt, oil, and makeup without completely stripping the skin; the second cleanse is usually a foam-based cleanser using one formulated with squalene or oats can be a good idea.

In fact, African Americans diagnosed with skin cancer usually have more serious cases because symptoms are detected in later stages. For that reason, you should be sure to use a daily sunscreen that will protect your skin from developing free radicals that can cause premature aging.

        Because some sun protectants contain titanium dioxide and since oxide can cause a white cast on darker skin, it may take some searching to find the ideal sunscreen for you. Sunscreens made with milky formulas and mineral additives tend to blend better into darker skin tones. You may also want to consider chemical sunscreens, which penetrate the skin to provide protection – but keep in mind that mineral sunscreens typically offer better overall protection.`,

        Among the benefits of adequate hyaluronic acid in your skin are localized volume and elasticity.

Dysport injections are usually about 2 centimeters deeper than Botox, which means they can cover a wider treatment area. Dysport results also tend to develop more quickly than Botox, but they don’t last as long.
        
        The primary difference between Botox and Xeomin lies in the formulation of the two injectable treatments. Xeomin is a pure form of botulinum toxin, while Botox contains that toxin as well as additional proteins. The pure nature of Xeomin means that it does not have to be refrigerated by your physician before it is injected. While this may be slightly more convenient for your physician when it comes to storing the injectable, it doesn’t make much of a difference for patients.`,

        But that is not to say all injectable fillers made with HA are the same, because they’re not. They differ based on the percentage of HA present and how they are crosslinked.

Unfortunately, collagen is one of the first proteins to fall victim to the aging process; the body naturally starts producing less as early as age 25.

        We can also use Sculptra to smooth your skin. This dermal filler uses a gentle substance known as poly-L-lactic acid to encourage your body to make additional collagen fibers. This process will make your skin tighter and firmer for up to two years.`,

        description: `In addition to dermal fillers, we also use a group of injectable products known as neurotoxins. These products do not contain hyaluronic acid or calcium-based microspheres. Instead, these products use a substance called botulinum toxin to minimize your wrinkles. Once we administer these products into your target area, they will stop your nerve signals from telling your muscles to make the movements that cause your skin to crease and fold.

        Our neurotoxins include Botox, Dysport, and Xeomin. We frequently use these products to address wrinkles and fine lines that appear on various locations on your face.`,

        description: `Using Voluma for cheeks will not preclude you from trying out other injectable products. In fact, it’s common to receive a combination of dermal fillers and neurotoxins. For example, we might enhance your face by injecting Botox into wrinkles between your eyebrows and administering Voluma for the cheeks. Alternatively, we might combine Voluma with a dermal filler that smooths your smile lines.`,

        description: `It’s common to receive Voluma in your cheeks during a liquid facelift. A liquid facelift is a minimally invasive treatment that uses a variety of injectable products to rejuvenate your skin. This technique is a great way to enhance multiple features of your face without going through an invasive procedure.

        We will complete your liquid facelift over a series of two to three appointments. During these sessions, we will administer a customized combination of fillers into your face. To give your body sufficient time to react to your injections, we will schedule these treatments over a period of several weeks. Although your results will be unique, the benefits of a liquid facelift may last for one to two years.

        description: `Since this product uses gentle ingredients to plump your cheeks, you are likely to be a good candidate for Voluma. In general, you will achieve the best results if you are a healthy person who wants to correct volume loss in your cheeks. To protect your safety, we will examine your cheeks and talk about your medical history before we administer your injections.

        Certain allergies and other health conditions can prevent you from using Voluma in your cheeks. In particular, you cannot receive Voluma if you have an allergy to lidocaine or to the Gram-positive bacterial proteins that are contained in the injectable solution. Further, you should not have a history of anaphylaxis or multiple severe allergies.`,
